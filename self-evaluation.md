# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?

**I feel good now that I understand that the 'each' method can be combined with 'if' statements.**

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

**It was intimidating and also felt very powerful once I was able to complete the assignments. I struggled a bit figuring out that I could use 'if' statements in combination with the 'each' method to solve some of the assignments. My small group provided great help.**

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

**I feel good about my understanding with the material that has presented so far. I am excited to learn more in the Methods Live Lesson later today.**

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

**How many versions of the 'each' method are there? I have seen the 'each_index'. I plan on looking at Ruby-Docs for more info.**
